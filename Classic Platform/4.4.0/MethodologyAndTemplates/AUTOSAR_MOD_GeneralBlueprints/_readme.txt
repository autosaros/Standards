The AUTOSAR specification contains several AUTOSAR models, such as the BSW UML 
model, and other information, such as traceability, in the AUTOSAR arxml 
format. In order to support the users of AUTOSAR and to get a closer 
understanding of the expected model content for an AUTOSAR system these AUTOSAR 
models are delivered as blueprints within this archive.

This ZIP-archive contains a set of arxml files with following content. All this
information is collected from some other AUTOSAR specification document. This 
ZIP archive does not introduce any new content.
* Meta Data of the deliverable (disclaimer, version, readme)
* KeywordSet for Predefined Names
* PortInterfaces and types for standardized service interfaces
* SwAddrMethods for SWS Memory Mapping

All contents are provided as Blueprints. They are not supposed to be used 
directly for a productive system, but the descriptions of a productive system 
can be derived from these blueprints.

Please note, that the KeywordSet for Predefined Names belongs to the contents 
of deliverable TR_PredefinedNames (UID 600) and therefore shows the UID and 
Version of this deliverable although it is part of the General Blueprints.
